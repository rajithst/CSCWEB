Servlets

A servlet is a Java class that runs in a Java-enabled server. An HTTP servlet is a special type of servlet that handles an HTTP request and provides an HTTP response, usually in the form of an HTML page. The most common use of WebLogic HTTP servlets is to create interactive applications using standard Web browsers for the client-side presentation while WebLogic Server handles the business logic as a server-side process. WebLogic HTTP servlets can access databases, Enterprise JavaBeans, messaging APIs, HTTP sessions, and other facilities of WebLogic Server.
Servlets and Java EE

WebLogic Server fully supports HTTP servlets as defined in the Servlet 2.5 specification at http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/index.jspOpens a new window. HTTP servlets form an integral part of the Java EE standard.

With Java EE metadata annotations, the standard web.xml deployment descriptor is now optional. The Servlet 2.5 specification, states annotations can be defined on certain Web components, such as servlets, filters, listeners, and tag handlers. The annotations are used to declare dependencies on external resources. The container will detect annotations on such components and inject necessary dependencies before the component's life cycle methods are invoked. See Chapter 8, "WebLogic Annotation for Web Components".

The Servlet 2.5 specification defines the implementation of the servlet API and the method by which servlets are deployed in enterprise applications. Deploying servlets on a Java EE-compliant server, such as WebLogic Server, is accomplished by packaging the servlets and other resources that make up an enterprise application into a single unit, the Web application. A Web application utilizes a specific directory structure to contain its resources and a deployment descriptor that defines how these resources interact and how the application is accessed by a client. See The Web Applications Container.
